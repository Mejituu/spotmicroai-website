# SpotMicroAI

## The Story
The SpotMicro model was originally developed by **[Deok-yeon Kim](https://www.thingiverse.com/KDY0523/about)** and released on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283). He has posted that he is required to join the military in his country for two years and so will be absent from development.

## The Community
The community has grown since then and different builds are available for everyone.

If you are eager to build your own, you can start joining us in slack: [spotmicroai-inviter.herokuapp.com/](https://spotmicroai-inviter.herokuapp.com/), we are very active in Slack. Or you can join the message board: [http://spotmicro.org](http://spotmicro.org)

## The Build
This is a reasonably priced quadruped.

Before you start you need to decide if you want to have:

* A fully simulated quadruped robot (pyBullet / ROS), **[Simulation build](https://gitlab.com/custom_robots/spotmicroai/simulation)**, this page contains the information to drive you through it.
* A simple quadruped robot controlled with remote bluetooth controller (PS4 or XBOX for example), **[Basic build](https://gitlab.com/custom_robots/spotmicroai/basic)**, the repository will guide you.
